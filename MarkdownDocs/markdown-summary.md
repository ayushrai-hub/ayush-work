## 3. Key Findings & Analysis

### Current Project Status
- **Overall Completion**: Consistent estimate of 45-75% across audit documents
- **Tech Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (some discrepancies with PRD's Next.js requirement)
- **Build Optimization**: 329KB bundle (target: <250KB), with lazy loading and code splitting implemented
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive with Jest + RTL and accessibility testing
- **Accessibility**: Excellent compliance (95-100% score) with WCAG 2.1 AA requirements

### Major Gaps Identified
1. **Contact Form Backend**: Missing serverless function integration
2. **Google Analytics**: Placeholder only, real GA4 tracking needed
3. **Bundle Size**: Increased to 402KB (73KB added from dependencies)
4. **Advanced Visualizations**: Missing GPA charts, radar charts, and client testimonials
5. **CMS Integration**: No headless CMS connection for dynamic content

## 4. Implementation Strategy Insights

### Risk Mitigation Priorities
- **High Priority**: Contact form, analytics, performance optimization
- **Medium Priority**: Skills enhancements, project testimonials, visual effects
- **Timeline**: Phased 12-week approach focusing on critical fixes first

### Quality Gates & Success Metrics
- TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Bundle size <250KB (currently over target)
- Lighthouse Performance â‰¥90
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- SEO optimizations (meta tags, structured data)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components (19 test files)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe
- E2E tests with Playwright
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## 5. Technology & Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript strict mode
- **Build Tool**: Vite with manual chunking for vendor libraries
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive coverage (>85% target)

### Backend & Integrations
- **Contact API**: Serverless function stub (needs implementation)
- **Analytics**: GA4 integration (completed in documentation)
- **CMS**: Headless integration (Sanity/Contentful recommended)
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL when CMS not used
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify with custom domain and SSL

## 6. Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 1)
