# Profile Image Setup Instructions

## Overview

I've created a Logo component and an enhanced About Me section that uses your professional photo. To complete the setup, you need to add your profile image to the project.

## Step 1: Add Your Profile Image

1. **Save the image** you provided in the chat to your computer
2. **Rename it** to `ayush-profile.jpg`
3. **Copy the file** to `/Users/ayushrai/CascadeProjects/new/ayush-work/public/ayush-profile.jpg`

## Step 2: Verify the Implementation

The following components have been created and integrated:

### ✅ Logo Component (`src/components/Logo.tsx`)
- Uses your profile image as a circular logo
- Three sizes available: `sm`, `md`, `lg`
- Includes your name "Ayush Rai" next to the image
- Integrated into the Header component

### ✅ AboutMe Component (`src/components/AboutMe.tsx`)
- Beautiful, animated section featuring your profile photo
- Professional styling with gradient backgrounds
- Your name "Ayush Rai" displayed below the image
- Includes key highlights and skills
- Responsive design for all devices

### ✅ Header Integration
- Logo component now appears in the website header
- Replaces the previous text-only logo
- Includes hover animations

### ✅ App Integration
- AboutMe component added to the main app
- Positioned after the existing About section

## Usage Examples

### Using the Logo Component:
```tsx
import Logo from './components/Logo';

// Small logo (32px)
<Logo size="sm" />

// Medium logo with name (48px) - default
<Logo size="md" />

// Large logo with name (64px)
<Logo size="lg" />
```

### Customizing the AboutMe Component:
The component is fully responsive and includes:
- Professional photo with your name
- Animated statistics
- Skills showcase
- Call-to-action button

## Next Steps

1. **Add the image file** as described in Step 1
2. **Test the website** by running `npm run dev`
3. **Verify the logo** appears in the header
4. **Check the About Me section** displays your photo correctly

## Troubleshooting

If the image doesn't appear:
1. Ensure the file is named exactly `ayush-profile.jpg`
2. Confirm it's in the `public/` folder
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache

## Image Optimization

For best performance, ensure your image:
- Is in JPG format
- Has reasonable dimensions (recommended: 800x800px or similar)
- Is optimized for web (compressed but high quality)

The components are now ready and will automatically use your profile image once you add it to the public folder!
